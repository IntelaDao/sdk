# Intela DAO

**A modular network of autonomous agents—auditable by design, self-reinforcing by nature.**

Intela DAO is a decentralized framework for building, coordinating, and governing autonomous agents in a transparent and verifiable way. Designed with modularity at its core, Intela enables scalable agent collaboration while maintaining auditability and resilience.

---

## 🌐 Overview

Intela DAO focuses on creating an ecosystem where autonomous agents can:
- Operate independently yet collaboratively  
- Be audited and verified on-chain or off-chain  
- Improve themselves through feedback loops and incentives  
- Scale across multiple use cases and environments  

The system is built to support experimentation, governance, and real-world deployment of intelligent agent networks.
